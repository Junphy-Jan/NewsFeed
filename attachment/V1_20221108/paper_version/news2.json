{"title": "Why Elephants Donâ€™t Get Cancer?", "content": "Scientists call it Peto's paradox: cancer is caused by gene mutations that accumulate in cells over time, yet long-lived animals that have lots of cells, such as elephants and whales, hardly ever get it. Why?\nFor elephants, at least, part of the answer may be the gene commonly known as p53, which also helps humans and many other animals repair DNA damaged during replication. Elephants have an astounding 20 copies of this gene, compared with humans' (and most animals') single copy. \nIn mammals, p53 plays a crucial role in preventing mutated cells from turning into tumors. It works by pausing replication and then either initiating repair or causing cells to self-destruct if the damage is too extensive. Without action from p53, cancer can easily take hold: in more than half of all human cancers, the gene's function has been lost through random mutations.\nThe fact that elephants possess multiple copies lowers the chance of p53 no longer working because of mutations. Additionally, elephants' p53 copies activate in response to varying molecular triggers and so respond to damaged cells differently, which likely gives an edge when detecting and weeding out mutations.
