{"title": "United Airlines Sees Future for Flying Electric Taxis", "content": "United Airlines is betting that electric air taxis will soon be speeding around U.S. cities. \nThe carrier on Thursday announced that it is investing $15 million in Eve Air Mobility, which makes flying e-taxis designed for short commutes in urban areas or to get to the airport. \nThe $15 million will cover 200 of Eve's four-seat flying taxis, also known as electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, or eVTOLS. Under the agreement, United will have the option to purchase 200 additional vehicles, with the first deliveries arriving in 2026. \nInstead of using traditional combustible engines, eVTOL aircraft use electric motors that deliver carbon-free flights. That promises to reduce pollution, noise levels and congestion, according to a joint announcement from United and Eve. The airline said the investment will help realize its goal of cutting carbon emissions to zero by 2050.\nThe Eve aircraft is envisioned to have a range of 40 to 60 miles. Future designs might be slightly bigger than the planned four-seater, but they would not replace any planes that United flies from one airport to another, so they won't reduce carbon emissions produced by the airline's regular fleet.
