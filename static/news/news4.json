{"title": "Genetically Modified Foods Not Tested for Allergenicity", "content": "Genetically modified foods are in the news more and more, as the debate over whether or not they are safe continues. \nA number of new GM products are in the pipeline, awaiting approval: Dow’s corn and soybeans resistant to the herbicide 2,4-D and Monsanto’s cotton and soybeans resistant to the herbicide dicamba; “Arctic apples,” genetically modified to keep from turning brown; and GM salmon, which grow twice as fast as normal salmon.\nThe GM salmon, produced by AquaBounty Technologies contains a gene from a Chinook salmon that produces a growth hormone, and a genetic “on-switch” from an ocean pout (an eel-like fish) that keeps the growth hormone pumping out year round.\nMichael Hansen, senior scientist with Consumers Union (publisher of Consumer Reports), contends that GM salmon have the potential to cause allergies and have not been adequately tested for allergenicity. \nHe is also concerned that, as the industry grows, fish farmers everywhere will be able to purchase GM salmon eggs and grow them in different environments.\nGM salmon might eventually be raised in ocean pens from which they could potentially escape; non-sterile GM salmon could contaminate other salmon and outcompete other fish.
