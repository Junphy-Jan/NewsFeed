{"title": "HHS: Price of More Than 1,200 Drugs Outpaced Inflation", "content": "More than 1,200 prescription drugs rose in price faster than the rate of inflation between 2021 and 2022, according to a new report released by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Friday.\nBetween July 2021 and July 2022, the prices for 1,216 drugs rose more than the 8.6 percent rate of inflation, with these products having an average price increase of 31.6 percent. The price increases observed in 2022 were affected by the high rate of general inflation this year. \nThe prices for some drugs rose by more than 500 percent in 2022. The antifungal fluconazole, a common medicine, saw increases of 1101 percent, with the price of one 150 mg tablet rising from $2 to $28.\nSome of the drugs that saw the highest dollar amount increases in 2022 include lymphoma medications like Tecartus, Yescarta and Zevalin as well as diabetes medications like Korylm, though the overall percentage increases were small due to the already enormous cost of these drugs.\nThe U.S. spent $603 billion on prescription drugs in 2021 before rebates were accounted for, with spending growth on drugs being driven by more expensive prescriptions as opposed to more prescriptions."}
