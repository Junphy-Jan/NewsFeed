He also criticized moves by GOP governors to transport migrants into the interior as a “stunt.”\nClinton spoke on a CNN podcast and was asked about “economic migrants” who are “gaming” the asylum system.\n“There is a limit to how many migrants any society can take without severe disruption and assistance, and our system is based much more on an assumption that things would be more normal,” the former president said. Clinton said that when he was a boy and a young man, Mexican migrants would move back and forth across the border to work in agriculture “and it worked for people.” But he conceded that the situation was now very different. \n“It’s an old story, but now you've got the largest number of refugees since World War II because of Syria and now Ukraine and other problems,” he said. Clinton also noted the recent surge in migrants from Venezuela that has increased in recent months, while also taking a shot at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for busing migrants into New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago."}
