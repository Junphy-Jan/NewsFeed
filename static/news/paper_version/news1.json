{"title": "Pro-Choice Protestors Disrupt Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center’s Banquet Screaming 'Blood on Your Hands'", "content": "Pro-choice protesters repeatedly interrupted a pro-life event near the nation's capital shouting obscenities and the message, 'You have blood on your hands.' Attendants at the Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center's Annual Banquet just outside Washington D.C. captured the chaotic moments on their phones and shared them to Twitter.\nWorld Magazine reporter Carolina Lumetta noted that one of the interruptions happened right as the center's executive director Janet Durig was talking about heightened security risks.\nA protester struggled with security as she refused to leave, and another activist screamed, 'You don't give a f--- about pregnant people,' as he was escorted out. Over 100 churches and pro-life organizations, including the Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center, have been attacked by abortion activists since the May 2 leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\nLeft-wing activists at ShutDownDC and OurRightsDC claimed responsibility for the protest. The abortion activists also stood outside the DC-area hotel where the event was hosted to protest. One person held up a sign that read, 'Jesus [loves] abortion' with a heart.\nThe crisis pregnancy center’s website states they offer women maternity and baby items, counseling, parenting classes, adoption and housing referrals as well as post abortion support among other resources, all free of charge."}
