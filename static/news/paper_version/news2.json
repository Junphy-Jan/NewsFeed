{"title": "Trump Wanted I.R.S. Investigations of Foes, Top Aide Says", "content": "While in office, President Donald J. Trump repeatedly told John F. Kelly, his second White House chief of staff, that he wanted a number of his perceived political enemies to be investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Kelly said.\nMr. Kelly, who was chief of staff from July 2017 through the end of 2018, said that Mr. Trump’s demands were part of a broader pattern of him trying to use the Justice Department and his authority as president against people who had been critical of him, including seeking to revoke the security clearances of former top intelligence officials.\nMr. Kelly said that among those Mr. Trump said 'we ought to investigate” and 'get the I.R.S. on” were the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe. \nHis account of Mr. Trump’s desires to use the I.R.S. against his foes comes after the revelation this summer that Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe had both been selected for a rare and highly intrusive audit by the tax agency in the years after Mr. Kelly left the White House.\nAfter Mr. Kelly left the administration, Mr. Comey was informed in 2019 that his 2017 returns were being audited, and Mr. McCabe learned in 2021 that his 2019 returns were being audited. At the time both audits occurred, the I.R.S. was led by a Trump political appointee."}
