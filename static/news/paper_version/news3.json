{"title": "Liberal Dark Money Network Funneled Millions of Dollars to Groups Connected to Top WH Officials", "content": "The behemoth liberal dark money nonprofit network operated by Washington, D.C.-based firm Arabella Advisors funneled millions of dollars to organizations founded or previously led by top White House officials.\nThe billion-dollar network — which consists of the Arabella-managed nonprofits Sixteen Thirty Fund, New Venture Fund (NVF), Hopewell Fund, Windward Fund and North Fund — gave at least $7.8 million to three groups tied to separate senior administration officials in 2021, the first year of President Biden's tenure. The five organizations under the Arabella dark money umbrella collectively raised nearly $1.6 billion from undisclosed donors last year.\nOverall, the network gave the largest sum to the E Pluribus Unum Fund, a group that Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor and Louisiana lieutenant governor, founded in 2018. Last year, Biden appointed Landrieu to be a senior adviser responsible for implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law he signed in November 2021.\nThe E Pluribus Unum Fund, which Landrieu started to combat racism in the South, received a whopping $3.2 million from the NVF in 2021, according to recently-disclosed tax filings. \nThe Arabella-managed nonprofit nexus has positioned itself as a top dark money network in the United States, raising more than $ 1.5 billion in anonymous donations and spending more than $1 billion to bankroll liberal endeavors in 2021."}
