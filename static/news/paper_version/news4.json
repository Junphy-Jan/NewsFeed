{"title": "Shift to Electric Cars Happening Too Slowly to Avoid \"Climate Catastrophe,\" Report Finds", "content": "Major automakers and governments have avowed that the future of cars is electric. And with transportation making up about a quarter of the carbon pollution emitted by humanity, scientists say phasing out gas- and diesel-powered cars is imperative for there to be any hope of avoiding the worst effects of global warming.\nBut the shift away from fossil-fuel burning cars is happening too slowly to stave off climate catastrophe, according to a report released by Greenpeace.\nThe researchers calculated how many new gas-guzzlers humanity can afford to put on the roads, assuming that global temperatures are on track to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. \nUnder that limit, the world's carmakers can build and sell 315 million gas-burning cars between now and 2050, Greenpeace calculated. However, carmakers have already planned to produce and sell nearly twice that number of gas-burning cars, the group's analysis found â€” 645 million to 778 million light-duty vehicles over the next 25 years.\nGas-burning cars will continue to be driven on roads and highways for years after the last one rolls off the assembly line. With the average age for a car now over 12 years, that means even if automakers' electrify in the next few decades, there would still be carbon-emitting cars on roads well past the middle of this century."}
