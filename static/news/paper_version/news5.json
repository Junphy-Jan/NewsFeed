{"title": "Left-wing Green Agenda Backed by John Kerry Would Be 'Disaster' for Developing World, Experts Say", "content": "The climate agenda pushed by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and left-wing activists across the world would cause severe devastation to third-world countries, according to a series of experts.\nThe experts argued that green energy technologies that Kerry and groups like Just Stop Oil have pushed for as a replacement for fossil fuels like oil and natural gas are unreliable and would threaten the stability of global energy supplies. \nSuch a green transition would acutely impact developing countries which have fewer traditional sources of backup power, they added.\n'We're telling developing nations that we don't want them to go through the process of developing, we don't want them to have coal or natural gas or even nuclear. We want them to use wind and solar which is intermittent, which is ineffective, which is incredibly cost-prohibitive,' Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future.\n'It's the epitome of privilege,' he continued. 'There is no greater white privilege than being a climate change activist. It is the privilege of rich and elite folks — you could even throw in the word godless if you wanted — who need to feel like they care about something in this world. So, they cling to the climate change cult, but they're unaffected by the consequences of it.'"}
