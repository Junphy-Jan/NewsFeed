{"title": "Mortgage Rates Climb Higher, Triggering Home Price Drops", "content": "Rates for the 30-year mortgage increased again this week, jumping to the highest level since October 2008, experts said. \nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.29% for this week, according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey. This is up from last week when it averaged 6.02% and is significantly higher than last year when it was 2.88%. \nOther loan terms also increased this week. The 15-year mortgage rose to 5.44%, up from 5.21% last week and up from 2.15% last year. The five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) also increased to 4.97%, up from 4.93% last week and up from 2.43% last year. \nSam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said that rising mortgage rates have led to a drop in home prices, but supply is still an obstacle to homebuyer affordability. “Impacted by higher rates, house prices are softening, and home sales have decreased,” Khater said. \n“But despite this decrease in sales, the number of homes for sale remains well below normal levels.” Housing inventory will likely remain constrained for the rest of this year, Lawrence Yun, National Association of Realtors’ (NAR) chief economist, said in a statement."}
