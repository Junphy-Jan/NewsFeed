{"title": "Bans on Critical Race Theory Threaten Free Speech, Advocacy Group Says", "content": "Over the past year, critical race theory has gone from arcane legal concept to potent political rallying cry, as Republican legislatures have rushed to introduce bills banning it and other “divisive concepts” in public schools.\nThe furor over the subject has sown chaotic protests at local school board meetings, and is credited with contributing to the election victory by the Republican Glenn Youngkin, who promised at nearly every campaign stop to ban critical race theory on his first day in office as Virginia’s governor.\nTo their proponents these bills represent a legitimate effort by parents to use the democratic process to shape education. But the measures have been widely assailed by Democrats (and a few conservatives) as a threat to liberal education and to the teaching of even some of the most basic facts about American history.\nIn a new report released recently, the free expression group PEN America emphasizes what it says is another threat they pose: to the free speech guaranteed in the First Amendment.\n“These bills appear designed to chill academic and educational discussions and impose government dictates on teaching and learning,” the report says. “In short: They are educational gag orders.”\n“Taken together,” it continues, “the efforts amount to a sweeping crusade for content- and viewpoint-based state censorship.”"}
