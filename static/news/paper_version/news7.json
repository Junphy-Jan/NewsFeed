{"title": "Doctor Warns 'Woke' Agenda Gaining Foothold in Medical Colleges: 'Diversity Above Merit'", "content": "A recent study from the Association of American Medical Colleges shows that diversity, equity and inclusion policies have gained a significant foothold in American medical colleges, and a medical expert says that poses a serious risk to the both quality of care and freedom of expression.\n'Med schools are devoting more and more time to these social and political issues, leaving less time for the study of medicine,' Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, board chair of Do No Harm, said in response to analysis released by the AAMC, which essentially serves as a report card for how its medical colleges are faring at implementing DEI policies that critics have described as a 'woke' agenda.\nThe report, which examined 101 medical schools, showed that 43% of schools 'have promotion and tenure policies that specifically reward faculty scholarship and service on DEI topics‚Äù and the number is highlighted in red suggesting that figure is inadequate. \nThe report also shows that 100% of the schools 'have admissions policies and practices for encouraging a diverse class of students.'\nGoldfarb, a board-certified kidney specialist who formerly served as associate dean for curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said that these DEI policies place less emphasis on merit and more on diversity benchmarks, which ultimately means quality of care suffers."}
